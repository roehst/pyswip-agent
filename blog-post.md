# Building a Reasoning Agent with Verifiable Logic: Prolog meets LLMs

Have you ever wondered how to build an AI agent that doesn't just *claim* to do calculations, but actually *proves* them? This is the story of combining Prolog's logical reasoning with LLM's natural language understanding to create something special: a reasoning agent where every calculation and logical inference is verifiable.

## The Concept

This small project shows how you can build a reasoning agent using **Prolog as the main engine**, with LLMs helping with natural language understanding and generation. It's as simple as it gets, yet incredibly powerful.

The agent uses OpenAI's Agents SDK and the PySwip library to interface with SWI-Prolog. It has access to a single function tool that takes a Prolog query as input and returns results as a list of dictionaries:

```python
@function_tool
def prolog_query(query: str) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
    print("************ Running Prolog query: ", query)
    result = prolog.query(query)
    print("************ Result: ", result)
    return result
```

With this single tool, the agent can:
- Add facts to the knowledge base
- Define rules and predicates
- Query the Prolog knowledge base
- Perform logical inferences and mathematical calculations

## The Architecture

The implementation is straightforward. Here's the core integration code:

```python
from agents import Runner, Agent, function_tool
from typing import Any
from pyswip import Prolog

class Miniprolog:
    def __init__(self):
        self.prolog = Prolog()

    def query(self, query: str) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
        return list(self.prolog.query(query))

def main():
    prolog = Miniprolog()
    
    @function_tool
    def prolog_query(query: str) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
        print("************ Running Prolog query: ", query)
        result = prolog.query(query)
        print("************ Result: ", result)
        return result

    instructions = """
    You are PrologGPT, an AI agent that can reason using Prolog.
    You have access to a Prolog interpreter via a single tool,
    `prolog_query(query: str) -> list[dict[str, Any]]`, which takes a Prolog query as input
    and returns the results as a list of dictionaries. If you must add new facts or rules,
    you can use query with assertz/1, retract/1, etc. Remember you can use listings, findall/3,
    and other Prolog predicates as needed. The full power of SWIPL is at your disposal.
    
    Your goal is to capture user knowledge in Prolog and reason about it.
    """

    agent = Agent(
        name="PrologGPT", model="gpt-4", instructions=instructions, tools=[prolog_query]
    )
```

## A Real Example: Economic Analysis with Verifiable Math

Let's see this in action with a macroeconomic analysis scenario. The interaction is purely conversational, but every calculation is verifiable through Prolog.

### Populating Facts

```
User: Populate the GDP of each Latin American country in billions of dollars for 2020

************ Running Prolog query:  assertz(pib(brasil, 1428)), assertz(pib(argentina, 383)), 
assertz(pib(chile, 282)), assertz(pib(uruguai, 56)), assertz(pib(paraguai, 40)), 
assertz(pib(colombia, 314)), assertz(pib(peru, 226)), ...

************ Result:  [{}]
```

The agent stores these as Prolog facts. Now they're in a structured knowledge base, ready for logical reasoning.

### Creating Rules

```
User: Create a rule that gives the ranking of a country by GDP

************ Running Prolog query:  assertz((ranking_pib(Pais, R) :- 
    findall(Pib, (pib(_, Pib)), ListPibs), 
    sort(0, @>=, ListPibs, SortedPibs), 
    pib(Pais, PibPais), 
    nth1(R, SortedPibs, PibPais)))
```

This creates a Prolog rule that:
1. Collects all GDP values
2. Sorts them in descending order
3. Finds a country's position in the sorted list

### Verifiable Calculations

Here's where it gets interesting. When asked to calculate per capita income:

```
User: Now with a query calculate the per capita income of Brazil.

************ Running Prolog query:  pib(brasil, Pib), populacao(brasil, Pop)
************ Result:  [{'Pib': 1428, 'Pop': 212.6}]

Agent: To calculate per capita income, we divide GDP by population:
Per capita income = GDP / population = 1428 / 212.6 = 6.71 (in 2020 dollars, in thousands)
```

### Computing Growth Rates

Even complex financial formulas like CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) become verifiable:

```
User: Create a CAGR predicate that calculates the CAGR of two values across two years.

************ Running Prolog query:  assertz((cagr(ValorInicial, ValorFinal, AnoInicial, AnoFinal, CAGR) :- 
    DiferencaAnos is AnoFinal - AnoInicial, 
    CAGR is ((ValorFinal / ValorInicial) ** (1 / DiferencaAnos) - 1) * 100))

User: Now, compute with this rule the CAGR of Brazil from 2000 to 2020

************ Running Prolog query:  pib_2000(brasil, Pib2000), pib(brasil, Pib2020), 
    cagr(Pib2000, Pib2020, 2000, 2020, CAGR)
************ Result:  [{'Pib2000': 644, 'Pib2020': 1428, 'CAGR': 4.061987665473099}]

Agent: The CAGR of Brazil's GDP from 2000 to 2020 was approximately 4.06%.
```

## Why This Matters: Verifiable Logic and Math

**Here's the crucial insight**: Unlike traditional LLM-based agents that might hallucinate calculations or make logical errors, this Prolog integration makes the logic and mathematics **verifiable**. 

Every arithmetic operation, every logical inference, every rule application happens in Prolog's formal logic system. You can see exactly what queries are being run, what facts are being used, and what results are returned. The LLM handles the natural language interaction, but Prolog ensures the reasoning is sound.

This is particularly important for:
- **Financial calculations** where accuracy matters
- **Logical reasoning** where consistency is critical  
- **Auditable systems** where you need to trace every step
- **Complex rule-based domains** where relationships matter

All interaction with Prolog is displayed transparently, so you can see what the agent is doing under the hood. This transparency helps you understand and verify what's going on at every step.

## The Bigger Picture: A Platform for Analysts

While this demonstration uses manually entered data, imagine the possibilities when this architecture is connected to real data sources and equipped with a comprehensive repertoire of computational models. For **economics, financial, and business analysts**, this could become a truly powerful analytical platform.

Consider the potential:

- **Live Data Integration**: Connect to financial APIs, economic databases, market feeds, and company reporting systems. The agent could pull real-time data and store it as Prolog facts, always queryable and always verifiable.

- **Rich Model Library**: Beyond simple CAGR calculations, imagine having predicates for:
  - Financial ratios (P/E, debt-to-equity, ROE, etc.)
  - Risk models (VaR, beta calculations, correlation analysis)
  - Economic indicators (inflation adjustments, PPP conversions)
  - Business metrics (customer lifetime value, churn prediction)
  - Forecasting models (time series analysis, regression)

- **Complex Reasoning**: Prolog excels at rule-based reasoning. An analyst could define complex business rules like "flag any company where debt-to-equity > 2.0 AND interest coverage < 1.5" or "find all markets where our market share is declining while the overall market is growing."

- **Audit Trail**: Every calculation, every data point used, every rule appliedâ€”all traceable. Perfect for compliance, peer review, and understanding how conclusions were reached.

- **Collaborative Knowledge Base**: Teams could build shared libraries of predicates and rules, creating institutional knowledge that's both executable and verifiable.

The combination of natural language interaction (via LLM), formal logical reasoning (via Prolog), and verifiable computation creates something unique: an analytical assistant that's both powerful and trustworthy. You can ask questions in plain English, get sophisticated analyses, and verify every step of the reasoning.

## Try It Yourself

The repo is available at `roehst/pyswip-agent`. It's a simple yet powerful demonstration of how formal logic systems and LLMs can work together, each doing what they do best: Prolog handling verifiable reasoning and calculations, LLMs handling natural language interaction.

The beauty is in the simplicity: one function tool, one Prolog interpreter, and suddenly you have an AI agent with verifiable logic at its core.
